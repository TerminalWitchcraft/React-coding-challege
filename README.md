# React Coding Challenge Project


## Organization

There are two components of the project. One is the React app itself developed using Next.js. The other being a ExpressJS server for backend api endpoints. Currently, MVC approach is not followed for express server as the number of endpoints is low.

## Installation and Running

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running in your system. We will be using ports 8000 and 3000 for running our apps.
